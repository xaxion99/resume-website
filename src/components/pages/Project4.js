						I became an engineer in part because I am good with numbers. 
						Number Simulator is a clicker and idle game inspired from the 
						classic JavaScript web game, Cookie Clicker.  For this game, I
						wanted take a game like Cookie Clicker and strip it down to the 
						rudimentary mathematics to make a bigger and bigger number.  The
						application was build in Python and has a UI developed in tKinter.
						The core concept of the game is that there is a clock that will 
						cause a tick every second change growing the number and the user 
						can additionally click to grow the number asynchronously. As the 
						playerâ€™s number grows they will be given opportunities to purchase 
						upgrades for their clicking and the clock tick.  I plan to continue 
						adding more future mathematical concepts to the game as upgrades 
						and adding in mini-games utilizing several of the already developed
						functionality in new and unique ways.'
