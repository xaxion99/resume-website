						I looked at it and thought, how can I solve this game?  I looked up a
						dataset of 5-letter English words and built a cryptographic application
						that can solve any Wordle game in the six guesses allowed.  The 
						application has tools for determining various useful statistics about
						all the five-letter words in the compiled dataset and displaying the 
						information in charts and graphs.  There is also a simple UI for taking 
						in manual user inputs and showing the user what words are possible in the
						dataset after each guess.  I tested the software for 150 days with no 
						failures.  Ultimately, the Wordle solver was a huge success and a great 
						learning experience for cryptography, English language statistics, and 
						of course bragging to your friends.'
