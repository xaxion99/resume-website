						interested in building a trading bot that could try to take 
						advantage of the crypto marketâ€™s volatility.  I initially
						started off trying to interface with another open-source
						crypto trading bot, but came to realize their system was
						not designed to do grid trading like I wanted to do.  Grid
						trading is an established forex trading strategy, which is
						why I chose it.  I ended up using a Python library and API 
						for the NDAX exchange to get the relevant trading stats and 
						functionality, then I was able to write an algorithm 
						for establishing the grid, and last I built a live updating 
						UI in tKinter. While the market has been extra volatile, the 
						bot has proven to be somewhat succesful.'
